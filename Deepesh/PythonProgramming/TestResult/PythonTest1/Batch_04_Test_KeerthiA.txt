1. Write a python program to calculate sum of all the numbers in the string.
str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
output = 89

for i in str1
print 

Marks = 0

2. Write a python Program to convert first and last character to upper case.
str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output = "PythoN ProgramminG IS VerY EasY TO LearN"


Solution:-

a = str1.split()
print(a)
res = []
for i in a:
 x = i[0].upper()+i[1:-1]+i[-1].upper()
res.append(x)
res = "".join(res)
print(res)

# Marks = 4


3. Write a Python Program to find out prime number from give list of values
list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
output = [13, 23, 29, 11]

Solution:

primelist =[]
for num in list1:

 for i in range (2, num//2+1):
if num % i == 0:
break
else :
primelist.append(num)
print(primelist)

# Marks = 1
