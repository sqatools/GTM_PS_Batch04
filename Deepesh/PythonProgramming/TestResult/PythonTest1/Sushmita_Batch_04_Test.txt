1. Write a python python program to calculate sum of all the numbers in the string.
str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
output = 89

str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
str2=str1.split()
list1=[]
sum=0
for val in str2:
    if val.isdigit():
        list1.append(val)

print(list1)

2. Write a python Program to convert first and last character to upper case.
str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output = "PythoN ProgramminG IS VerY EasY TO LearN"

str1="python programming is very easy to learn"
str2=str1.title()
str3=str2.split()
#print(str3)
list1=[]
for char in str3:
    list1.append(char[0:-1]+char[-1].upper())

print(list1)

3. Write a Python Program to find out prime number from give list of values
list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
output = [13, 23, 29, 11]

list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
prime=[]
for i in list1:
     count=0
     for j in range (1,i):
        if i%j==0:
             count+=1
     if count==1:
          prime.append(i)

print(prime)

4. Write a python program to create below output dictionary with given string.
str1 = "India is best cricket teams"
output = {5: "IndiA", 2: "IS", 4: "BesT", 7:"CrickeT", 5: "TeamS"}

str1='India is best cricket teams'
str2=str1.split(" ")
dict1=dict()

for val in str2:
    count=0
    count=count+1
    dict1[val]=count

print(dict1)
