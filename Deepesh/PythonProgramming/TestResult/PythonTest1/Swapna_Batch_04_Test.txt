1. Write a python python program to calculate sum of all the numbers in the string.
str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
output = 89

2. Write a python Program to convert first and last character to upper case.
str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output = "PythoN ProgramminG IS VerY EasY TO LearN"

3. Write a Python Program to find out prime number from give list of values
list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
output = [13, 23, 29, 11]

4. Write a python program to create below output dictionary with given string.
str1 = "India is best cricket teams"
output = {5: "IndiA", 2: "IS", 4: "BesT", 7:"CrickeT", 5: "TeamS"}
