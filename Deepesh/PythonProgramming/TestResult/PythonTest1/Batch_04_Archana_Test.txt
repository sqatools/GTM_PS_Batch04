output = 89

str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
list1 = str1.split()

Marks = 0

str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output = "PythoN ProgramminG IS VerY EasY TO LearN"

str2= "python programming is very easy to learn"
str3= str2.title()
str4= str3.split()
for i in str4:
    if (str4[i] == str4[::-1]):
print(str4)

marks = 1

3. Write a Python Program to find out prime number from give list of values
list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
output = [13, 23, 29, 11]

list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
prime= True
for i in list1:
    if list1[i]%i ==0:
        prime= False5
        break
    else:
        continue
    if prime:
        print(list1)
    else:
        print("not prime")

marks = 2
