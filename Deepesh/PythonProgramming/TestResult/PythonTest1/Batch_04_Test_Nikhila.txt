1. Write a python python program to calculate sum of all the numbers in the string.
str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
output = 89


str1= "Good 12 Morning 45 , Hope 2 you are 30 doing good"
output = 0

str2=str1.split(" ")
print(str2)
for char in str2:
    if char.isnumeric()==True:
        a=int(char)
        output =output+a
    else :
        continue
print(output)



2. Write a python Program to convert first and last character to upper case.
str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output = "PythoN ProgramminG IS VerY EasY TO LearN"

str1= "python programming is very easy to learn"
output =" "

str2=str1.split(" ")
print(str2)
for char in str2:
       output=output+char[0].upper()+char[1:-1]+char[-1].upper()
       #print(end=" ")
print(output,type(output))

3. Write a Python Program to find out prime number from give list of values
list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
output = [13, 23, 29, 11]


list1 = [13, 56, 77, 23, 29, 11]
#output = [13, 23, 29, 11]
output=[]
count=0

for n in list1:
    for i in range(1,n):
        if n%i==0:
            continue
        else:
            output.append(n)
print(output)

4. Write a python program to create below output dictionary with given string.
str1 = "India is best cricket teams"
output = {5: "IndiA", 2: "IS", 4: "BesT", 7:"CrickeT", 5: "TeamS"}

str1 = "India is best cricket teams"
#utput = {5: "IndiA", 2: "IS", 4: "BesT", 7:"CrickeT", 5: "TeamS"}
str2=str1.split()
print(str2)
output = {}
for char in str2:
    output[len(char)] = char[0].upper()+char[1:-1]+char[-1].upper()
    print(output)
